#when you test scores feature use command
DISPLAY=localhost:1.0 xvfb-run cucumber features/scores.feature

#or if you want to test all features together run
DISPLAY=localhost:1.0 xvfb-run cucumber 

#Since I have set waiting time to be 10 seconds, in most time the 
view scores page can refresh within 5 seconds plus communication time
between driver and backgroud rails application process. I test over 10 times and
it is sucessful. If you see it failed once after run several times that is
due to the data race, or the system is slow (or crashed) and communication takes a long time 
and the capybara  stop send request after timeout which is very very very 
unlikely to happen. Generally speaking, 10 seconds is highly safe.
